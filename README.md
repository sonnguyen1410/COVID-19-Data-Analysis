# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
This is my individual project that looks into the infection rates of COVID-19 for different countries and how they relate to a country's GDP, Life Expectancy, Social Support and Happiness etc.
This project is based on a guided project offered by Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid19-data-analysis-using-python
