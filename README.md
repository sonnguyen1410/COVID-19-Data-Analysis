# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
This is my individual project that looks into the infection rates of COVID-19 for different countries and how they relate to a country's GDP, Life Expectancy, Social Support and Happiness etc.

This project is based on a guided project offered by Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid19-data-analysis-using-python 

## Objectives
There are two main objectives of this project: Firstly, I want to look into the infection rate amoung countries over time to see which countries were hit most and which sufferred much less than others. Secondly, I want to know if there is any relationship between a country's infection rate and its scores in the World Happiness Report such as GDP per capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to make life choice, etc.
